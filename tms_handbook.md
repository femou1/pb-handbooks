# The Mayhem Syndicate

</div>

Welcome to the Mayhem Syndicate, we unite as brothers in arms and cause chaos to large groups and militaries all across Robloxia. Using high-tech weapons and alien technology, we bend those who oppose us to our will.

We primarily celebrate destruction as the Pinewood Computer Core raid group, where we attack the core and don't let PBST get in our way.

# General Reminders
* Follow the [ROBLOX Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Rules) and the [Pinewood Builders Game Rules](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/pinewood-builders-game-rules/907637) **at all times.** 
* Be respectful to other members, especially to those who outrank you, we're all playing to have fun.

* Do not try to evade punishments, evading will only make it worse.
* We are not at war with other groups, hostility towards them is unwelcomed. 
* You are not allowed to share/sell accounts with TMS marks/ranks.
* Follow orders from your superiors and be respectful to your fellow players. Don’t act like you’re the boss of the game.
* Glitching is severely frowned upon, doing this at events can get you on KoS for all sides until the event ends.
* **Instructors can remove a user from a TMS position for poor behavior,** both in the communications server and in-game. This includes toxicity, inappropriate behavior, etc. Anyone who acts in ways not suitable for his/her rank will see that rank revoked.
* Do not steal any assets that relate to Pinewood Builders or its members, including but not limited to; Game assets, uniforms, and community-made artwork. **You will be blacklisted if you refuse to remove stolen assets.**
* Attacking other on-duty TMS members is frowned upon and can lead to punishment.
* PBST must have both a rank tag set to PBST and PBST uniform to be counted as PBST! (unless they are Special Defense+ or have a hazmat/core/fire suit)
---
# Global Rules
PBST, PET and TMS Leadership have agreed to prevent unfair advantages to the best of their ability. During on-going events, there exists a multitude of Global Rules which needs to be followed by all subgroups during events. Below lists every one of them currently in force:

1. Attendees are not allowed to glitch in any way, it is disallowed for all sides. If a neutral glitches during events, they will be on Global-KoS.

2. Attendees are not allowed to “package abuse”, which basically means attendees cannot make super small packages or other packages that can negatively impact other players, it is disallowed for all sides. If neutrals package abuses during events, they will be on Global-KoS.
3. Raid Blacklisted users are Global-KoS to all sides.
4. Attendees cannot fight and kill each other in the main spawn area, the Security room, the Syndicate hideout, or the Emergency HQ. The only exception to this rule is if you’re fighting someone and during the middle of it they decide to run to any of the mentioned areas in order to escape said fight, in which case you are free to kill them there.
5. To avoid team-killing and general confusion, on-duty TMS may not color their hazmat shades of blue during raids or patrols.

In these rules, “all sides” refers to all main pro-core and anti-core subgroups, PBST, PET and TMS.

By committing any of the mentioned rules while also being on-duty for TMS, you can expect an appropriate punishment in the group; ranging from a point deduction up to a demotion. In some cases, one may get added to the PB Event Blacklist, where one is on permanent Global KOS during public server PBST/PET/TMS events, and are banned from attending private server PBST/PET/TMS events.

# Rules while raiding

These rules are for anyone who has their ranktag set to **The Mayhem Syndicate** (Red **Syndicate** title)
[details="Uniform"]
*While your rank tag is set to TMS, you are required to wear the official TMS uniform! This considers you onduty.* 
If you refuse to wear a uniform and still actively try to destroy the core, you would be treated as if you are on duty. PBST may still KoS you.
You can find the **TMS Hideout** at the Pinewood Computer Core near the Cargo trains platform.

The TMS hideout is located near the Cargo train spawn at Pinewood Computer Core.
If you happen to be in a facility that does not have a TMS uniform giver, you can be on-duty as TMS without one.

You are **not** allowed to wear a PBST uniform while on-duty as TMS, this is severely enforced if caught. 

Captain+ are allowed to wear modified/custom uniforms. If you had a pre-Inquisitor uniform approved by an Instructor; you are still allowed to wear it.

If you have Donor Commands, you can give yourself a uniform through the !shirt and !pants command
___Uniform Texture IDs___
Shirts: `4428565863`
Pants: `4428568303`

Links for the Uniform
https://www.roblox.com/catalog/4428568331/TMS-Uniform-Pants
https://www.roblox.com/catalog/4428565917/TMS-Uniform-Shirt

Better yet, you can combine those two into an alias, run this command in chat
`!addalias !tmsuniform !shirt 4428565917 & !pants 4428568331`
Then, every time you run `!tmsuniform` in chat, you will put on the TMS uniform!

**You must have Donor Commands to do the above**

You can additionally use the command `!tmsuniform`. This gives you the default TMS uniform and colors your Hazmat to red! If you prefer a black hazmat helmet, you can do `!tmsuniform2`

[/details]
[details="Weapons"]
Syndicate members are given Weapons at the Pinewood Computer Core to assist in destroying the core or causing chaos, these can be found at the Hideout near Cargo trains. **Weapons become more powerful and diverse as you rank up.** More information regarding what tools can be achieved can be seen in the **Ranks** section.

Weapons given are not to be used while off-duty or on-duty for another group. 

**You are not allowed to use PBST tools or PET tools (Fire Hose, Medical Box, or PET shield) while on-duty as TMS**

The Loadout area, or the TMS Hideout, is shown below in the photo
<div align="center">

![image|659x500, 75%](upload://cjTWr3IpbU0O6L2BbXNy6LpwDx2.jpeg) 

</div>
[/details]
[details="Encountering PBST"]
While raiding, you will most likely encounter the Security of the Computer Core. These members will actively attack you. 

You are to **kill security on sight**, with a few exceptions.
* You cannot kill PBST if they are in spawn, they are protected by spawn restrictions.
* You cannot attack a security officer going to get their loadout, you may if they attack you first. More information on this is explained in the "PET/PBST Room" dropdown, some exceptions are listed there!
* The PBST member must be both **on-duty as PBST** and **wearing an official PBST uniform** to be attacked if the member is a **Special Defense** rank or above in PBST and has their ranktag set to Security, you may kill them if they don't have a uniform on. You can ignore this rule if the PBST member is a threat and/or is interfering with your meltdown/freezedown objective.

There are rare occasions where a PBST officer goes rogue and will help destroy the core, these people appear every so often and pose no threat to the Syndicate.
[/details]
[details="Encountering PET"]
PET members are by default not a threat to TMS but can aid the enemy in combat. Treat PET as you would a normal member, if they interfere with your objective or are attacking you/other teammates, you are free to kill them.

You are to **kill PET on sight IF** the core temperature is above 2,000 degrees or below -2,000 degrees with a few exceptions like PBST.
1. Spawn/loadouts are protected, you should not attack there. 
2. For PET to be on-duty, they would be either wearing a PET suit, have a PET tag, or have the PET tag and are interacting with core / aiding PBST / putting out fires / etc 
[/details]
[details="PET/PBST Room"]
PET and PBST both have rules to not attack in the TMS loadout area, so we respect this mutually with them in the form of not attacking in their respective loadout room.
The only exception to this is if you are attacking someone outside of one of these rooms initially and they run inside for "protection". By all means, feel free to kill them there. This protection only really applies to people who recently spawned and are still getting their loadout. If they do not immediately go to loadouts after spawning (/core suits), they are excluded from this protection.
[/details]
[details="Neutrals"]
Do not go out of your way to attack neutrals while raiding, if they are not a threat or are not interfering with your objective, try to avoid killing these types of players. 
---
[/details]
[details="Glitching"]
Do not actively use glitches during raids, this is discouraged and will lead to disciplinary action
[/details]
[details="Nerve Gas"]
Should you be a ranked member, you have access to Nerve Gas. Treat this as you would a weapon that deals damage. Do not use this in spawn nor other protected areas; like loadout rooms. 
[/details]
[details="Exploiter KoS"]
When encountering an exploiter, similar to how PBST does it, you are more than welcome to KoS them until a moderator can join to properly deal with them. 
You are free to spawn-kill them if you have...
> **APPROVAL FROM A PIA MEMBER**
> ALREADY HAVE **QUALITY** VIDEO EVIDENCE (can't count pixels, can read names, and shows the person in question doing any of these)
> 1. Fly/Noclip/Superjump/Teleport exploiting
> 2. Fling exploiting
> 3. WalkSpeed exploiting

Should you be caught spawn killing someone without approval AND evidence, it will be charged as spawn killing. 
[/details]
[details="Encountering Enemy Sentries"]
PBST has their own sentries, hinted at by the blue coloring 
![image|577x470, 75%](upload://zI1fvMsn8y0nBrWSuKVGiJTMocn.jpeg)
Upon seeing these, they likely also see you and will start firing at you assuming they still have ammo in reserve. It is advised to find the placer of the sentry and kill them before you try and destroy the sentry as they can just place another down rather quickly upon it's destruction (cooldown pending addition) 

PBST/PET can hack our own sentries, see the gray body and blue circle on top to signify a hacked TMS sentry. 
[/details]
[details="Team switching"]
During all official subgroup events, you are not permitted to switch teams. 
This consists of changing your onduty status from TMS to either PET, or PBST. 
Going off-duty and becoming a neutral during events however, is allowed.
[/details]
--- 

While on duty as a Syndicate member, you are expected to help cause chaos by melting or freezing the core. There are times where multiple Syndicate members are trying to do different objectives, communication is key to success! Work together to meet a common goal and success will follow. 

[details="PET/Core Suits"]
You are allowed to wear PET Hazmat and PET Fire suits or the general core suit while on duty as TMS. A uniform is not required while wearing these suits. You are not allowed to wear the PET Medical suit as an on-duty TMS member.

TMS are allowed to use the Astronaut helmet during raids, this can be used in the core when the temperature is below 3000. 
Astronaut Helmet ID: `1081366`

[/details]
[details="Events"]
Every so often at Pinewood Computer Core, a disaster will occur. These disasters do vary and can change the gameplay dramatically. These disasters are as follows;
* Meltdown
* Freezedown
* Gas Leak
* Earthquake
* Plasma Leak
* Blackout
* Radiation Leak 
* Aliens
* Magma
* Missiles

You are **not** allowed to fix the Radiation leak unless it is preventing meltdown or freezedown from occurring. 
During **Missiles**, you want to keep the defense system **offline** to ensure the missiles hit the computer core!
[/details]
[details="Dealing with Rogue Syndicates"]
Every so often, you may encounter a syndicate member trying to save the core, breaking a game rule, team-killing other members, or abusing weapons. These members are considered Rogue. Depending on how they act, you may have to kill them in self-defense if they attack you on invalid terms. 

If you run into a ranked individual (Trooper+) abusing their TMS-specific weapons, send a Group Weapon Abuse call to PIA and note the weapons they are using. 

Captains and up can declare an individual rogue and put them on Kill-on-Sight.

If you run into someone who can be considered rogue, make sure they know that what they are doing is against our handbook and can get them placed on KoS if they continue.

Rogue Syndicates are;
* Teamkilling on purpose
* Spawnkilling or Mass random killing on purpose
* Breaking the handbook on a large scale

Captains and up can directly file for a deduction on someone, but you can report the rulebreakers to them as well. 
[/details]
[details="Coolant Pipe"]
You are allowed to repair the pipe when a freezedown is an objective, but not allowed to repair it when a meltdown is an objective. Keep it broken in the case of a meltdown, repaired in the case of a freezedown. Ignore it during Chaos raids, unless there is a second objective; if so follow the former. 
[/details]
[details="Inquisitor+ Custom Uniforms"]
# Custom Uniforms
These uniforms must be based off of pre-existing uniform layouts.
Any customization must be minor and additionally approved by an Instructor+

# Raid System
Official Raids are hosted often in the Mayhem Syndicate. 
**You must be an Inquisitor+ to host an Official Syndicate Raid.**

Marks can be earned during an official raid. The amount given varies depending on the raid level and how long you attended it. Behavior and participation during the raid are taken into account.
[details="Practice Raid"]
These raids are meant to be practice, as no marks are given to attendees. These can be hosted by Inquisitor+. One mark is possible as a bonus, but not required to be given. 
[/details]
[details="Level 1 raid"]
Level 1 raids award up to 3 Marks. These can be hosted by Inquisitor+
[/details]
[details="Level 2 raid"]
Level 2 raids award up to 5 Marks. These can be hosted by Inquisitor+
[/details]
[details="MEGA raid"]
MEGA raids award up to 9 Marks. These are organized by Instructor+. Inquisitor+ can host a server during these MEGA raids. 
These raids stand out from normal raids as they are multiple raids hosted at once. 
[/details]
[details="Incursions"]
Incursions are large events that take place inside PBCC, primarily as a sort of KOTH event. Multiple points around the map will be selected as the "hill", which needs to be maintained. 
These primarily give out Level 2 amounts of marks.
[/details]
[details="Other Events"]
Instructors may also host a variety of unique events for a fun and new experience, some that have occurred are listed below. 
- Reverse Raid
- 10x Freezedown Raid
- Stabledown
[/details]
[details="Patrol Raids"]
These raids give 0 marks. Can be hosted by a Captain+, these raids are pointed towards PBST Patrols to create a fun event for both parties. Patrol raids do not follow normal hosting permissions
Patrol raids run on a separate schedule from normal raids; allowing them to run at the same time as normal raids. These raids also have no cooldown time following them, but only 1 patrol raid can be hosted at a time as they cannot overlap. 
[/details]
[details="Mayhem Strikes"]
These raids are not pre-scheduled, but rather are a surprise event that an Inquisitor+ can host in a **public** server. Your primary goal can be Melt, Freeze, or Chaos, with a secondary goal of helping recruit more members into the Syndicate. These strikes will give up to 1 mark per attendee, at the hosts discretion, so don't always expect them. 

These are to bring back the original charm of TMS, small group raiding a public server with the resistance being the public server players themselves. It is advised to join the Comms server to get notifications on when these happen. You must be 13+ to join it, as per site rules. The link is in the Social Links of TMS.
[/details]
<br> 

[details="Bonus Marks"]
During dismissal of a marked raid, the raid host can pick a certain number of attendees to receive the bonus.

Recommended:
00-19 attendees : 1 recruit & 1 ranked member
20-29 attendees : 2 recruits & 2 ranked members
30-39 attendees : 3 recruits & 3 ranked members
40+ attendees : 4 recruits & 4 ranked members

This aims to reward newer members for helping despite the likely chance they are not fitted with very good weaponry. Everyone is essential to a raid!
[/details]
--- 
Raid hosts do have to follow rules regarding hosting, all hosts do. The rules these members have to follow are shown below under the Raid Hosting Rules section
[details="Hosting Rules"]
All times when a day starts or ends are decided by UTC.
* Captains may host up to 1 patrol raid every 48 hours.
* Inquisitor+ can only have **ONE** Level 1+ raid a day **EACH**. 
* If the last raid was a **MEGA** raid, you must wait at least 8 hours after that raid started before you can host another.
* If the last raid was a **level 2** raid, you must wait at least 5 hours after that raid started before you can host another. 
* If the last raid was a **level 1** raid, you must wait at least 3 hours from the start time of the last raid.
* If the last raid was a **level 0** raid, you must wait at least 2 hours after that raid started before you can host another. 
* There must be a **ONE** hour period between the end of any official raid and the start of the next official raid.
* Hosts cannot start a raid if it is 1 hour before the PBST mega or takes place during the PBST mega. 
* Captains can only schedule 4 days in advance.
* Inquisitors can schedule up to 14 days in advance.
* Instructors+ do not have a limit to how far ahead they may schedule, this is for more important events like Trainings or MEGA raids.

All hosts (Captains, Inquisitors, Instructors, and the Architect) are expected to follow these. Instructors and up have the authority to end a raid early or cancel it ahead of time if it violates the raid hosting rules.

Captains+ can use a powerful communications server bot to schedule events, which automatically checks the hosting rules.

There is no set cooldown for trainings, but raids cannot occur during a training session.
[/details]
[details="Starting Temperature"]
This applies to both public and private server raids, but this is more heavily enforced for private server raids. For private servers this is a cap, while for public servers this is a recommendation. 
For raids, the starting temp must be between these sets of values
> **MELTDOWN**
> -300 to 800 degrees

> **FREEZEDOWN**
> -800 to 200 degrees

> **CHAOS**
> Does not matter the starting temp unless there is a second objective, if so see above entries

Temperatures that exceed these ranges can call for the server to be shut down or a Facilitator to set the temp manually, or for all sides to help get the temperature of the server to within the range before starting the raid. 

Failure to follow these guidelines multiple times can result in a demotion, aka the inability to host any more raids. 
[/details]
--- 
The Mayhem Syndicate holds a variety of different raids, these can be seen below in detail.
[details="Meltdown"]
Meltdown raids are the most common raid found at TMS. The goal is simple, cause a meltdown. This is done by raising the temp beyond 4000 degrees and preventing successful E-Coolant from succeeding and cooling the core. Should E-Coolant succeed, TMS should work towards reaching 4000 again.
[/details]
[details="Freezedown"]
Freezedown raids are one of the rarer raids found at TMS. The goal is simple, cause a freezedown. This is done by lowering the temp below -4000 degrees. 
[/details]
[details="Chaos"]
One of the most fun raid types, is the Chaos raid! This raid is where TMS shines in its more *chaotic* stages. During these raids; massive fires break out, nuke trains explode, and core temperatures soar into unstable numbers.
[/details]
[details="Post-raid"]
This is not an objective, but it is an objective once the primary objective is reached after a Meltdown or Freezedown begins, it is to do a No-Survivor or Yes-Survivor run, or none at all.

It is expected that a survivor run is to be called BEFORE the first rocket starts to launch. By that point, it will default to YSR.
* **Yes-Survivor (YSR)**
Help survivors escape in rockets
This is the default objective in all post-raid scenarios unless specified otherwise.
* **No-Survivor (NSR)**
Do not let anyone escape in rockets.
You must be an Inquisitor+ to order this run as you can be charged with MRK violations otherwise. 
Operative+ can request permission to engage this run in a server.

Once a raid that offers marks ends, TMS members are to head to the Rynver Stronghold, with the **!tmsrs** command in chat. This is to group up, submit a log for everyone who attended, and then dismiss everyone. The event host may want you to go somewhere else, so keep a lookout for where it might be! It'll likely be TMSRS, but not always!

Last but not least, after a Meltdown starts, E-Coolant must be considered to prevent PBST from saving the core.
[details="E-Coolant Information"]
# E-Coolant Overview
E-Coolant, or Emergency Coolant, is a gameplay aspect that lets users have a chance at saving the core once a Meltdown begins. It is located in Sector G, both doors require the code **5334118** to open. 

E-Coolant does play a critical role and must be kept under control, or risk getting the core temp set back to lower amounts.

For E-Coolant to have a chance at saving the core, at least *one* of the rods must have their levels between **69 and 81** percent to be green. Going above or below those ranges will make the rod unusable. 

Success Rates for the number of tanks green when the countdown reaches *0*
1 : 25% 
* Core temp set to 3600
2 : 45%
* Core temp set to 3400
3 : 90%
* Core temp set to 3000

The more e-coolant succeeds in a consecutive amount the less effective it is. This only resets after a melt/freeze or if enough time without a melt/freeze passes.

The E-Coolant door has an integrity system that is health-based. Upon reaching 0 health, the door will malfunction and open partially for a short period, before falling down and temporarily locking itself while it is self-repairing. 

It is important to take advantage of this when TMS is not controlling E-Coolant. It is just as important to protect the door by deploying fields in front of it to block bullets from passing into the door. The door self-repairs itself after not taking damage for 5 seconds and will continue to heal itself until it takes damage again or reaches max health.

# Trainings
Trainings are hosted periodically and are done at any facility, even other games. Trainings can give 1 to 5 Marks (5 being the bonus) depending on performance. Bad behavior during trainings can lead to removal from the training and no marks awarded. Negative marks can also be issued if the situation requires them.

# RankLocks
**RankLocks** are a special system in Pinewood. It lets divisional HRs easily tell other divisional HRs whether a user can be promoted or not. This can be used as a sort of moderation action against someone or merely keeping track of something like a promotion cooldown. They often can be appealed if they are a result of a moderation action. 

You are unable to appeal a ranklock from the result of a promotion cooldown.

# Operative EAS

Operative+ are granted the ability to see raid alerts a few minutes early. 

This lets more ranked members ensure a slot if they wish to attend a specific marked raid rather than fighting with others to join. 

Few rules come along with this:
1. Until the raid is publicly announced, you may **not** begin the raid internally. Once the raid has been announced publicly wait about a minute or so then you can begin the actual raid. Until then you are not to touch core controls to further the final objective. You can help setup the core to be in the appropriate starting range and stable (if melt/freeze is an objective).
2. If you are joining after an EAS has been sent out and before the public is alerted, you are expected to go TMS. Failure to do so can risk being reported for abusing your authority as Operative+. 
3. You are asked not to share EAS alerts with non-Operatives or people who do not intend to respond to a raid as TMS. You risk getting the other person in trouble for doing so as well.
